		EXTRA NOTE
********************************

1. How to label game/app version?
[Major build number].[Minor build number].[Revision].[Package]

i.e. Version: 1.0.15.2

Major build number: This indicates a major milestone in the game, increment this when going from beta to release, from release to major updates.
Minor build number: Used for feature updates, large bug fixes etc.
Revision: Minor alterations on existing features, small bug fixes, etc.
Package: Your code stays the same, external library changes or asset file update.

2. Some notation
<!test> 		<== becomes red in Sublime
<!-- test --> 	<== becomes green in Sublime
